# Tomcat Dummy
Derived from the ZetCode's [Tomcat Derby tutorial](http://zetcode.com/java/tomcatderby/) (2018.03.20)

## What works
`./gradlew war` produces a WAR file which can be manually deployed.

There's a "Show all" page (<war-name>/controller?action=listcars) and a form for adding more cars.
